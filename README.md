The Froot Smuuthie Randomizer
The group members are Jeff Moro, Daniel Apacible, and Anthony Salazar.
The Froot Smuuthie Wheel will allow you to have fruit smoothies based on a random wheel spinner. You will have to spin the wheel to get a random fruit and then a smoothie recipe will be given based on the fruit spun in. In the selection you will be able to delete fruit(s) you would not like in your smoothie. With the selected fruit you will recieve fun facts about the fruits.
As a fruit lover, I want to create a fruit color wheel, so that I can help users pick fruits for any kind of smoothie they want to create.
The technologies we used are bulma for CSS and the APIs are Openweather for optimal temperature and Edaman.com for nutrition data.
The breakdown of tasks and roles are Jeff and Anthony doing HTML and CSS, Jeff and Daniel doing Javascript.
We created our spinning wheel which will randomize what fruit you're gonna get with a click of a button and added a openweather API to tell the temperature of the fruit that was selected by the wheel.
THe challenges we encountered are getting the circle to spin and figuring out how to give the point on the circle a value.
What we could've done with more time are displaying ingredients on the page inside the div, calculate the total amount of calories on the page, add additional nutrition information for recipes, make the wheel spin in a manner reminiscent of the wheel of fortune wheel, highlight the fruits that were already selected, cut off the recipe at four fruits, and having a mobile friendly view.
